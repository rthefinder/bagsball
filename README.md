## 🎯 What is bagsball?

**bagsball** ($bagsball) is a meme coin that leverages two powerful Bags primitives to create a self-reinforcing flywheel:

1. **DividendsBot** — Automatically distributes trading fees to holders proportionally
2. **BagsAMM** — Provides automated market making and liquidity support

The concept is simple: **trading volume generates fees → fees drive dividends and AMM support → increased support drives more volume → the ball keeps rolling.**

### Why Bags?

Bags is a Solana-native launchpad with built-in infrastructure for fee sharing and automation. By launching on Bags, bagsball gains:

- ✅ Native DividendsBot integration for holder rewards
- ✅ BagsAMM for continuous liquidity support
- ✅ Eligibility for the **$1M → $100K** platform incentive
- ✅ Transparent, verifiable on-chain configuration

### The Flywheel

```

cd bagsball

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build all packages
pnpm build
```

### Running Locally

```bash
# Start development servers (all apps)
pnpm dev

# Or run specific apps
cd apps/web && pnpm dev        # Dashboard on http://localhost:3000

- **[DividendsBot Integration](docs/DIVIDENDS_BOT.md)** — How dividends work

### Integration Details

Both BagsAMM and DividendsBot are **independent systems** operated by the Bags team:

- ✅ bagsball configures fee sharing at launch
- ✅ Bots operate autonomously based on their logic
- ❌ bagsball does NOT control bot operations
- ❌ bagsball does NOT access bot internals
- ❌ No guaranteed outcomes or timing

All activity is **verifiable on-chain** for full transparency.
