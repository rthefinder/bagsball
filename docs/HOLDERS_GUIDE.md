### 3. Hold in Your Wallet

⚠️ **Important**: To receive dividends, keep tokens in your personal wallet, not on an exchange.

## Receiving Dividends

### How Dividends Work

1. **Trading fees accumulate** in DividendsBot
2. **When threshold is met**, dividends become claimable
3. **You claim your share** based on % owned
4. **Receive SOL/fees** directly to your wallet

### Checking Dividend Status

**On bagsball Dashboard**:

- Look for "Accumulating" or "Claimable"

- Check "My Dividends" section

   - Click "Connect Wallet"
   - Approve connection in wallet popup

3. **View Claimable Amount**
   - See your share of accumulated fees
   - Amount = (your % of supply) × (total fees)

4. **Claim**
   - Click "Claim Dividends"
   - Approve transaction in wallet
   - Pay small gas fee (usually < 0.001 SOL)
   - Receive your dividends

## Common Questions

### How often can I claim dividends?

Depends on trading volume and bot threshold. Could be daily, weekly, or longer.

### What if I don't claim?

Dividends typically remain claimable. Check DividendsBot docs for specifics.

### Do I get more dividends if I hold longer?

Dividends are based on % ownership at snapshot time, not duration of holding.

### Can I trade and still get dividends?

Yes, but your share is calculated at snapshot time. If you sell before snapshot, you won't receive that cycle's dividends.

### Are there minimum holding requirements?

No minimum, but very small holdings receive proportionally small dividends. Gas fees might exceed dividend value.

### What if BagsAMM or DividendsBot stop working?

Contact Bags support. bagsball doesn't control these bots.
